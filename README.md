## Features

This repository includes two primary programs:
1. **Navier-Stokes Equation Solver with Kolmogorov-Type Forcing**  
   A solver implementing Kolmogorov-type forcing for various flow dynamics studies and proof for validity of this computation.

2. **Navier-Stokes Equation Solver with Forcing based on Annulus Fourier Coefficient**  
   A solver using annulus Fourier coefficient forcing for specialized simulations.
