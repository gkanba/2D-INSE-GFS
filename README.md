## Features

This repository includes two primary programs:
1. **Navier-Stokes Equation Solver with Kolmogorov-Type Forcing**  
   A solver implementing Kolmogorov-type forcing for various flow dynamics studies and proof for validity of this computation.

2. **Navier-Stokes Equation Solver with Forcing based on Annulus Fourier Coefficient**  
   A solver using annulus Fourier coefficient forcing for specialized simulations.

Additionally, some data assimilation codes are provided for research purposes.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to build and run this project:
- **[Eigen 3.4](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/)**: A C++ template library for linear algebra.
- **[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/)**: A C library for computing the discrete Fourier transform.
